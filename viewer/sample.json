Each innitiative must have its own dedicated folder within the repository. The folder name must follow this format: <innitiative id>, space, <innitiative name>. For example, `INN001 New line of phosphorescent t-shirts`.\n  * Each time a new innitiative is approved, a subfolder will be created within the main 'initiatives' folder or equivalent.\n  * Establish and enforce clear naming conventions for both documents and folders to ensure consistency and facilitate efficient search and identification.\n1.  **Access Control Implementation:**\n\t* Implement a robust, role-based access control (RBAC) system to ensure that only authorized individuals can access, modify, or share sensitive and confidential documents.\n\t* The [[Innovation Sponsor]] and the [[Innovation Manager]] must have full administrative access to the entire repository.\n\t* [[Innitiative Manager]]s must have edit access to their respective project folders and read-access to general program documents.\n\t* Program participants and [[Innitiative Contributor]]s should have access tailored to the documents relevant to their specific roles and responsibilities (typically read-only for general docs, contribute for specific task docs).\n4.  **Comprehensive Innovation Process Documentation:**\n    * Ensure that all documents and artifacts generated during the innovation process are systematically archived in the repository within the correct innitiative folder (e.g., market research findings, user personas, design sketches, wireframes, prototype test plans, user feedback summaries, validation reports, final presentations).\n5.  **Data Backup and Recovery Strategy:**\n    * Implement an automated and regular data backup system to protect against accidental data loss, corruption, or system failures.\n    * Establish and document a disaster recovery process to ensure business continuity for the innovation program in case of an unexpected critical event.\n6.  **Communication, Training, and Onboarding:**\n    * Clearly communicate to all program participants the existence, purpose, and location of the document repository, along with procedures for accessing and utilizing the information effectively.\n    * Provide adequate training and onboarding materials on naming conventions, folder structure, version control, and access control procedures to all users.",

These techniques aim to foster creative thinking and gather diverse perspectives.\n\n### Steps for Opportunity Generation:\n\n1.  **Select and Apply Idea Generation Techniques:**\n\t* Employ a range of techniques suitable for the organizational context, such as:\n\t\t* **Brainstorming Sessions:** Structured or unstructured group sessions to generate a high volume of ideas.\n\t\t* **Design Thinking Workshops:** Empathetic, user-centered approaches to uncover needs and ideate solutions.\n\t\t* **Employee Interviews & Suggestion Schemes:** Tapping into the knowledge and insights of frontline staff and other employees.\n\t\t* **Co-creation with Stakeholders:** Collaborative sessions with customers, partners, or suppliers to generate shared-value opportunities.\n\t\t* **Market and Technology Trend Analysis:** Scanning for emerging technologies, market shifts, and competitor actions.\n\t\t* **Benchmarking:** Learning from best practices and innovations in other companies, both within and outside the industry.\n\t\t* **Customer Journey Mapping:** Identifying pain points and opportunities for improvement from the customer's perspective.\n2.  **Gather Diverse Information and Insights:**\n\t* Collect relevant information from a multitude of sources:\n\t\t* Internal data (sales figures, operational metrics, employee feedback).\n\t\t* External market research data and industry reports.\n\t\t* Direct customer feedback (surveys, interviews, support tickets).\n\t\t* Academic research, scientific publications, and patent databases.\n3.  **Analyze, Synthesize, and Identify Potential Opportunities:**\n\t* Systematically analyze the collected information to identify patterns, connections, emerging trends, and recurring problems or unmet needs. Synthesize these findings into clearly articulated, concrete innovation opportunities.\n\n### Recommended Tools and Techniques:\n\n* **iNNitiatives app:** Directly use the 'Opportunities' section in the iNNitiatives app to initially capture and document the raw outputs from generation activities before formal registration.\n* **Digital Whiteboards (Miro, Mural):** For virtual brainstorming and idea organization.\n* **Survey Tools (Typeform, Google Forms):** For collecting widespread feedback.\n\nBy following this process, the organization can build a rich pipeline of potential innovation opportunities, which then feed into the registration and evaluation stages.",

This helps in early-stage sorting.\n4. **Ensure Field Completion**: Verify that all mandatory fields in the 'Opportunities' section of the iNNitiatives app are accurately and consistently filled for the new entry.\n\nThis structured registration process creates a valuable, queryable database of potential innovations, forming the basis for more detailed evaluation.",

This step goes deeper than the preliminary evaluation during registration and is crucial for making informed decisions about which opportunities to advance into formal initiatives.\n\nFor each registered innovation opportunity:\n\n1. **Detailed Evaluation**: Evaluate the opportunity more thoroughly based on:\n   - **Technical Feasibility**: Can the proposed solution be developed and implemented with available or acquirable technology and expertise? What are the technical risks?\n   - **Strategic Alignment**: How well does this opportunity align with the organization's specific strategic objectives, innovation goals, and market focus? Does it leverage core competencies?\n   - **Potential Impact/Value**: Quantify or estimate the potential benefits. This could include financial returns (ROI, new revenue), operational improvements (cost reduction, efficiency), market advantages (market share, competitive differentiation), or social/environmental impact.\n   - **Resource Requirements**: Estimate the likely resources needed (financial, human, technological, time).\n   - **Risks and Challenges**: Identify potential risks (market, technical, financial, operational) and challenges to successful implementation.\n   - **Market Attractiveness/Demand**: Is there a clear customer need or market demand for this? What is the size of the potential market?\n2. **Assign/Refine Priority**: Based on the detailed evaluation, adjust or confirm the priority of the opportunity. This often involves a scoring model or a committee review. Consider factors like:\n   - **Urgency**: How quickly is a solution needed to address the problem or capitalize on the opportunity?\n   - **Strategic Importance**: How critical is this opportunity for achieving strategic goals?\n   - **Benefit/Effort Ratio**: Compare the potential benefits against the estimated effort and resources required.\n3. **Document Evaluation Outcomes**: Record the findings, scores, and rationale for the assigned priority in the 'Opportunities' section of the iNNitiatives app or a linked evaluation document. Ensure the information in the following fields is updated or confirmed:\n   - `Opportunity - Priority`: Updated priority value.\n   - Potentially add new fields for scoring against specific criteria (e.g., `Opportunity - Strategic Fit Score`, `Opportunity - Impact Score`).\n   - Notes on key findings from the evaluation.\nThis process helps to create a prioritized backlog of opportunities, ready for selection to become formal 'Innitiatives'.",
