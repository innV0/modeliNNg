Your task is to improve the content of the item titled '{{itemTitle}}'.

### SAMPLE_ITEM

This is an example of the expected JSON output structure. Replicate this structure and detail level if applicable to the request.

{{#sample_item_block}}
{{{sampleItem}}}
{{/sample_item_block}}

Based on ALL the context (description, document structure, and the sample item example), provide an improved version of the content for the item '{{itemTitle}}'.
- Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object with a single field "content" containing the improved content.
- The improved content should be more detailed, better structured, and higher quality than the original, while maintaining the same general meaning and purpose.

Example response format:
```json
{
  "content": "This is the improved content for the item. It is more detailed, better structured, and higher quality than the original."
}
```
