Your task is to suggest relevant tags for the item titled '{{itemTitle}}'.

### SAMPLE_ITEM

This is an example of the expected JSON output structure. Replicate this structure and detail level if applicable to the request.

{{#sample_item_block}}
{{{sampleItem}}}
{{/sample_item_block}}

Based on ALL the context (description, document structure, and the sample item example), suggest appropriate tags for the item '{{itemTitle}}'.
- Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object with a single field "tags" containing a comma-separated string of suggested tags.
- Consider both standard tags and special format tags (e.g., "type::value" or relation tags like "relates>>OtherItem").

Example response format:
```json
{
  "tags": "important, type::concept, relates>>AnotherItem"
}
```
