Initial Assessment: Review the Haunted Site Report for location specifics, reported phenomena, and historical context.\n1.  Equipment Calibration: Ensure all spectral detection equipment (EMF meters, thermal scanners, audio recorders) are correctly calibrated per manufacturer guidelines.\n1.  Environmental Sweep: Conduct systematic sweeps of the location, recording EMF fluctuations, temperature anomalies, and unusual sounds.\n1.  Data Analysis: Analyze gathered data to identify potential spectral signatures. Cross-reference readings with historical data and known paranormal indicators.\n1.  Entity Classification (If Possible): Based on available data, attempt to classify the entity (e.g., poltergeist, residual haunting).\n\nDeliverables:\n*   Ghost Profile: A detailed report outlining the entity's suspected characteristics, including energy signature, behavior patterns, and potential origin. Include raw data logs and analysis summaries.",

Perimeter Establishment: Based on the Ghost Profile, identify the ghost's likely movement patterns and establish a secure perimeter using caution tape and warning signs to prevent civilian interference.\n2.  Proton Trap Placement: Position the proton trap in the center of the ghost's identified zone of activity. Ensure the trap is on a level surface and free from obstructions.\n3.  Equipment Calibration: Utilizing the Ecto Scanner, calibrate the proton trap to the specific energy signature identified in the Ghost Profile. Fine-tune the containment field frequency to maximize capture efficiency.\n4.  Deployment Initiation: Activate the proton trap remotely, initiating the containment field. Monitor the field's integrity using the Ecto Scanner, adjusting field parameters as necessary to maintain a stable trapping environment.\n5.  Verification: Once the ghost is contained, verify successful capture using the Ecto Scanner, confirming that the energy signature is stable within the trap's confines.\n\nDeliverables:\n*   Trapping Field: A fully operational electromagnetic containment field, verified for stability and effectiveness in containing the identified ghost.
