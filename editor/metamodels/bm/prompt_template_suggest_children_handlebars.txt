Your task is to suggest child items for the parent item titled '{{itemTitle}}'.

Based on ALL the context (description, document structure, and the sample item example), suggest appropriate child items for the parent item '{{itemTitle}}'.
- Your response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON object with a single field "items" containing an array of suggested child items.
- Each child item should have "title" and "content" fields. You may optionally include a "tags" field if appropriate.

Example response format:
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "First Child Item",
      "content": "Description of the first child item.",
      "tags": "tag1, tag2"
    },
    {
      "title": "Second Child Item",
      "content": "Description of the second child item.",
      "tags": "tag3, type::example"
    }
  ]
}
